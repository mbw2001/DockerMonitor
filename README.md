Integration for monitoring Docker containers from within Home Assistant.

STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!

The code is based on [Sanderhuisman](https://github.com/Sanderhuisman/home-assistant-custom-components)'s docker monitor, with some changes:
 - Updated to support installation through [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)
 - Allow for configuration through the the integrations UI
 - Allow for modifying the entities through the UI.
 - Some work towards a more asynchronous implementation

## Installation
Best installed using [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) by adding mbw2001/DockerMonitor as a custom integration repository

## Configuration:
Integration is configured through the integrations UI.
